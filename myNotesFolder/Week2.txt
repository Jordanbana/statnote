Final Paper Part 1 is due on Blackboard soon- look under content
Paragraph on selecting a social problem and describing the objective conditions of the problem and the facts
Draw on the four-part definition of social problems described in lecture as well as the definition provided by best ch 1 to argue why you would define this issue as a problem, based on how sociologists asses whether something is a social problem or not (1 page)
Imagine you are a claimsmaker constructing this issue as a social problem. Drawing on chapter 2 and lecture, identify at least 2 strategies you would use to convince other that your issue is a social problem

Claimsmaking
Each stage of the social problems process involves rhetoric and resources
Rhetoric: strategies to make a persuasive argument
Resources: what people bring to the social problems process; what’s available to advance the process
First step: claimsmaking: calling attention to a troubling condition
Rhetoric of claims
Grounds: information and evidence
Warrants: justification, appeals to values
Conclusions: recommended change, policies
Grounds:
Descriptions of the troubling condition
Basic rhetorical recipe/strategy
Typifying example/atrocity stories: shapes public’s perception of what the condition is like (stories do not reflect “typical” cases)
Problem is named: given an orientation
Statistics: implies how severe the troubling condition actually is
Big numbers preferred because they suggest that condition is widespread and thus serious enough for others to pay attention
Other Rhetorical Strategies
Claims that problem is getting progressively worse
Familiar type of problem
Difference within sameness
Piggybacking
Keep it simple
Construct profiles of both victims and villains
Personalize the condition and the victims
Range claim: many different kinds of people are hurt by the troubling condition
Construct a common condition: law of large numbers; middle class victims
Challenges to other ways of constructing the social problem
Construct for the media
Ex. food stamp fraud
Strategies used:
Typifying example- picked the most extreme case, surfer dude who doesn’t work and eats luxuries
Naming the problem: “great food stamp binge”
Statistics suggesting severity- $200 free money, make it seem like he does this every day
Progressively worsening problem: Obama signing the first bill and then it got worse
Familiar type of problem
Profile of victim and villain
Range claim
Constructing for media
Warrants
Why we should be concerned about the troubling condition; focuses on why we “ought to care”
Utilize values (standards of good and bad, right and wrong) that a majority of people share
Ex. freedom, justice equality, protect children, etc.
Best to use multiple warrants in order to cover as many possible reasons why people should care as possible
Conclusions
What should be done about the social problem; the solution
Resources used to construct claims
Cultural resources: claimsmakers construct claims to appeal to cultural ideas, norms, and values that already exist
Cultural diversity means there are multiple options for how to construct claims
Must relate to social problems audience
Social problems Audience
Claimsmakers must try to create claims that others will find persuasive
Valence issues: topics that nearly everyone will agree are significant social problems
Not convincing claimsmakers that it’s a problem, but more that something has to be done
Ex. murder
Position issues: topics over which it is unlikely that most people will ever come to consensus
Ex. abortion
Alternative statistics
Fewer than 2% of SNAP benefits are given to ineligible families
Benefits actually have been decreasing for people who don’t’ deserve it (based on a graph)
Social Problems Audience
Audiences are differentiated or segmented
Different social demographics often creates smaller audiences which worry about only a certain kinds of social problems the most
These segmented audiences may have different interests and ideologies
Tactics for claimsmaking to various kinds of segmented audiences
“preach to the choir”: make claims only to those who think as your group does
seek out the widest possible audience, for claim, often using multiple grounds and warrants to accomplish this claimsmaking goal
Social Problems Marketplace
Numerous claims about a variety of social problems bombard the audience
Claimsmakers struggle to get the audience’s attention and keep refining their claimsmaking in an effort to be more successful
Even if their issue has become well-established as a social problem, claimsmakers need to keep refining their claims so that the problem does not become stale and cause it to lose attention by policymakers and the general public
Claims and Audiences
How do claimsmakers refine claims to keep audience attention?
Domain expansion: redefine/broaden the definition of the problem thereby adding in more possible victims to help and villains to control
Piggyback: when a newer claim builds upon an older, more established social problem’s claimsmaking, saying that “it is just like X” where “X” is the more established problem
Counterclaims: sets up debates
Example: negative effects on children of growing up in poor neighborhoods
Historic claims: effects on access to schooling, job outcomes, teen pregnancy
Newer claims: PTSD, violence, fight or flight
Piggybacking on PTSD awareness due to soldiers coming home from war and other adult trauma
Domain expansion to adults: 43% of Chicago trauma center hospitals suffer from PTSD (gunshots)
Claims across space and time
Social problem: health issues during pregnancy
1950s: claims that morning sickness and stress were big problems during pregnancy, solution was medication
today: claims that most medication is not okay during pregnancy
US: advice to pregnant women to avoid alcohol, soft cheese, and certain types of fish
France: perfectly acceptable to drink moderately
Japan: no sushi stigma, few dietary changes
Claims process over time
Missing children
1981: first mention of “missing children” as a social problem
encompasses runaways, child-snatchings, custodial parents
domain expansion
grounds- definitions, orientation statement, statistics
warrants for missing children:
value of children
blameless victims
associated evils
rights/freedoms
historical continuity
conclusions for missing children:
stranger danger
awareness
prevention
policies
milk cartons
Social problems arise due to the reactions of people to conditions
The first step in the social problems process is claimsmaking
Claims are made using rhetorical strategies and drawing on cultural resources
Grounds, warrants, conclusions
Social problems exist in a marketplace: claimsmakers need to gain and keep attention
