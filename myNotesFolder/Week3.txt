Step 2: Media Coverage
Media’s Role in the Social Problems Process
Secondary role: Reporting on primary claims made by outside claimsmakers
Primary claims- messages from claimsmakers
Secondary claims – taken from experts/activists and change it to make it more dramatic, shorter, simpler for their audience (Media)
Primary role: Media can also make claims about an issue previously not seen as social problem
Bringing a social problem to public attention can lead it to getting on the policy agenda or becoming public priority
Social Construction of Media Coverage
What the media covers is influenced by
Economic constraints
Timing and deadlines

Media Bias
Political Bias: Conservative v. Liberal
Drudge Report, Fox News, National Review, Rush Limbaugh, Washington Times
Daily Kos, Mother Jones, MSNBC, Salon, Talking Points Memo, The Nation, NYT
Mainstream Bias – group of media outlets that cover the same sorts of things that effect less marginalized groups
Corporate Bias – big corporations own media outlets, so accused of making their corporation look good
Advertising Bias – media outlets depend on advertisers to keep them afloat: choosing content based on what advertiser wants (ex. target middle aged white women)
Racial Bias – accused of covering issues that privilege one race over another
Top Hat: In general, do you think the news media are too liberal, just about right, too conservative
Our class: 40% say too liberal
General Public: agrees
Top Hat: How much trust do you put in the media? Class – 50% says yes
General public: in the 70’s, most people did, now only 44%
There used to be fewer media outlets, now cable and lots of options

Liberal outlets scored higher- they know the truth and report it more
Most people prefer news with no political point of view!
Audience Segmentation
Does mass media mean that everyone is getting the same sources?
Or do people see media sources that match what they already think?
Audience segmentation: media sources cater to the demographics that are their audience
90% of our class gets news through media outlet’s website
