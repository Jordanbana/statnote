Media Coverage of Ferguson
At first, no one covered the topic
Then social media picked it up
After protests started, Obama made a speech, and the name of the officer was released, the US takes interest in it
Media as constructing the social problem (angles)
Freedom of the press
Racial inequality
Police brutality
Rioting and looting
Media coverage itself
Daily Show – Jon Stewart has liberal views on the matter
Media Bias on Ferguson
If black officer shot a white teen: most people think less coverage would be given
#IfTheyGunnedMeDown on Twitter – if they were killed, what photo would be used by the media
Summary about media:
Step 2 in Social Problems Process: Media Coverage
Gets attention fro claims to encourage public reaction
Media both presents the claims and constructs the claims
Media is socials constructed
Public Reactions to Claims
The make or break point for most social problems
Role of Public in Constructing Social Problems
Receive claims from claimsmakers and media
Feedback to media: shapes media coverage
Feedback to claimsmakers: determines need to reframe, keep claims fresh
Feedback to policymakers: opinions and votes
How do we measure public reaction?
Polls
Constructing public opinion
Sampling
How a question is phrased
Social desirability bias
Typical national polling method: Gallup
Goal: all or most Americans have an equal or known likely chance to be selected
Historically: selecting places of residence from all possible geographic areas within the country and knocking on doors
1986: telephone; 2008: cell phone sampling
start with computerized list of all telephone exchanges in the U.S. and estimate of how many phones have these exchanges [exchange = 3 digits after the area code]
random digit-dialing
ask for adult 18+ with most recent birthday
typical sample size for U.S. population: 1000 adults
responses weighted by gender, race, age, educational attainment, region
Sampling Issues
Famous one: Literary Digest Poll, 1936
Presidential election: Alfred Landon v. FDR
Prediction: 57% Landon; 43% FDR
Actual results: 62% FDR, 38% Landon
Method: Created mailing list from telephone directories, club membership lists, magazine subscribers of 10 million names; sent a ballot to be returned to the magazine
Selection bias and nonresponse bias
They forgot about poor people, those who don’t subscribe to magazines, not everyone responded to the ballot, those who aren’t as opinionated, who have more time, elderly
Non-response bias
I go on Facebook, and just don’t care
From 1997 to 2012, people responded less and less
Harder to contact people
How a question is worded
Often surveys/polls will rotate ordering of options (favor/oppose)
Can construct something as a social problem
Ex. 2013 Gallup poll about the Affordable Care Act
Fighting in Iraq: 75% supported in 2003, 40% now
Social Desirability Bias
Questions about
Drug and alcohol use
Sexual behaviors/preferences
Health
Risky/illegal behavior
Income
Self-esteem
Religious affiliation
Intelligence/education levels
Voting
Fact: rich people underreport what they earn, poor people incorrectly report
Social Desirability Example: Voting (ask people who they voted for after they left the polls)
1960 Exit polls: Kennedy and Nixon nearly tied (closely matched reality)
1964 (post JFK assassination): Americans reported voting for Kennedy by a 2:1 margin
2002: When GW Bush’s approval rating was 82%, polling indicated he received a 12% advantage in 2000 election
2009: Americans reported giving Obama a 20 point win (it was 7)
Social desirability Example: Sex and Relationships
2013 study compared reports of relationship and sexual behavior data between data collected via face to face interviews and private computer assisted self interviewing among 16 to 18 year olds
Males in face-to-face interviews were 60% more likely to report ever having had a girlfriend
Females were honest
Power of Public Reaction
Public as activists: protestors
Public as voters and constituents
Public as media consumers
Public as Activists: Occupy Wall Street
Started as single blog post
Number of demonstrators in NYC grows all fall
Large unions show support
Movement spreads to more cities
Public opinion and policymaking
Large-scale shifts in public opinion lead to shifts in policy, especially for salient issues
Gay marriage
Effects of protests in other countries on Canada’s decision to stay out of Iraq
In ~25% of cases, policy moves in opposite direction of public opinion
Policy can change before opinion
Public Opinion: Impact on Claims
Contemporary Legends
Joke Cycles
Feedback to claimsmakers → refining claims
Review: The Social Problems Process
Definition
Step 1: Claimsmaking
Step 2: Media Coverage
Step 3: Public Reactions
Preview: Social Problem of Crime
Is crime a social problem?
Best’s definition: social problems are conditions that people have subjective reactions to and respond to by calling for change
If we define crimes as actions that break established law, is a crime an objective social problem?
Crimes represent condition that have gone through the social problems process, from Claimsmaking to policymaking?
Process of Creating Laws and Sentencing
Follows the social problems process of something becoming crime
Example: Legal History of Marijuana
Late 1800s: marijuana was a popular ingredient in medicine and sold in pharmacies
1906: Pure Food and Drug Act requires labeling of cannabis contained in over-the-counter products
1900-1920s: Mexican immigrants introduce recreational use of marijuana leaf
marijuana menace: claims of links to social problems and crime
1937: Marijuana Tax Act
1950s: mandatory sentencing for drugs, including marijuana
Process of Changing Laws
Also follows social problems process!
Claims about benefits: started with medicinal marijuana
Is marijuana use a social problem if it becomes legalized?
Should we legalize weed?
60% of class says yes, and same in America right now!

Discussion: Are Teenagers Responsible?
Before the age of 21: prefrontal lobes are not fully developed, so decision making skills are not fully developed
The way our brains are developed, our brains are more subjective to drug abuse and alcohol abuse, we are more heavily affected by it
2 categories of teenagers: 1 group is adolescent limited, 2 is lifetime persistent
is the individual more likely to only commit this crime because they are a youth?
Wasn’t until 1920 that govt. realized that child crime committers should focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment
Factors to consider:
Level of offense
Juvenile records
Age
Past rehabilitation efforts 
Once an adult, always an adult: if you have been tried as an adult previously, you will always be charged as an adult
Advantages of being tried in an adult court:
Has a jury (versus one judge in juvy)
Disadvantages:
More severe sentences
Social stigma
USC grad student beaten and died
2 people involved were over 18, automatically tried as adults
death penalty or no?
19 year old drove the car
other 2 were 16 and 17, still considered juveniles, not sure
can’t have death penalty
actually used the bat to beat the kid
Slender Man case
12 year old girls stabbed their friend 19 times and she survived
driven to kill her by this user generated online fiction thing when slender man told them to do it, on a game
character representing stalkers, walk around and find papers but its all in the dark
Debate: the act was premeditated, but they think a guy is controlling them- its hard to determine how they should be tried

Perspectives on Crime: Social Pathology and Deviance
How would you describe the problem of crime in the US?
America’s views: 55% say high, 38% say moderately, 5% say not too bad
Background: Facts about Crime in the U.S.
Index crimes
Violent crimes (murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault)
Property crimes (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft)
Drug crimes: Possession/use; sale/distribution
Crime Drop since 1980’s to now – Chicago still at the top
Freakanomics: since abortion became legal, crime rate has dropped since people who can’t take care of their kids (the ones who end up as criminals) would not be born
Prison boom: we increased the rate at which we imprisoned people in the 70’s, and it just started to flatten out
The war on drugs
Victimization Reports – ask people if they have been victims of violent crime in the past year, offenders known (self-reported)
Crime is very spatially concentrated
Drug Arrests
Enforcement has gone up even though usage has gone down
Crime as a Social Problem
Socially constructed
Many different perspectives
Claimsmaking process can shape how we understand why it’s a social problem, its causes, and its solutions
Two perspectives: Social pathology and deviance
Historical context
Sociology started in the late 19th century
Urbanization: lots of migrants to cities
Industrialization: difficult working conditions
As social problems became visible, activists and scholars tried to explain them and fix them
Social Pathology Perspectives
Social Problem: Persons or situation that interfere with the “normal” workings of the social organism
A violation of moral expectations (how things should be)
Organic analogy
Prior to early pathology arguments, deviant behavior was seen as sin or as chosen
Organic Analogy
Pathology in medical science: physical disease
Analogy: society is an organism, and social problems are the “sick” part of the organism
All parts of society are inter-connected, like an organism, so sickness must be corrected in relation to other parts of society
Deviants are sick and must be cured
Objective or subjective definition?
Persons or situation that interfere with the “normal” workings of the social organism
Objective: social problems are things that harm society
Critique: organic analogy assumes that we can identify the objective conditions that interfere the normal functions of the organism
We cannot describe a “normal state” of human society
Causes of a social problem
Failure of socialization
Relationships, fixing institutions (school or prison)
Individuals can’t keep pace with changing society
Early perspective: defective, dependent, delinquent
Society isn’t keeping up with changing conditions
Institutions are failing to socialize individuals successfully
Closer to contemporary views
Society is pathological, not the individual
Conley: stimulus overload
Multiple selves compete for attention within one’s own mind
Deviance Perspective
What is deviance?
Behaviors/situations that depart from social norms
Social norms: mainstream, conventional rules of society
Why do people violate normative expectations?
Inappropriate socialization (social pathology says FAILED socialization)
Early pathology: people can’t learn the rules
Late social pathology: wrong values being learned → deviance
Individuals face situations where achieving goals is blocked by lack of opportunities, they act deviantly and tech these strategies to other sin similar position
People learn deviant behavior through contact from primary groups (family, friends, peers, personal companions)
People learn techniques, motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes
Learn whether legal codes are favorable or unfavorable
Age Crime Curve
Levels of crime at different ages can be described by the age-crime curve
The horizontal axis shows age
The vertical access shows the rate of offending
Onset of crime in late childhood/early adolescence, peaks at late teens/early twenties, then people desist
Males are involved in crime more than women, but same shaped curve for both
Nonwhite more than white
Life Course and Deviance
Life course theory: childhood, adolescence, adulthood
Age-graded social roles
Deviance: inappropriate socialization
Disconnect between cultural goals and structured opportunities can lead to delinquency, which is learned from peers
Do people choose to cause social problems?
Balance between free choice and determinism
Whose fault is it?
Individual or socializing agents?
What accounts for the highest rates of crime? (pick one)
Unemployment, social distress
Failure of the criminal justice system
Crisis of personal values
Drugs
Media and violence
The way judges apply the laws
Social conditions
Solutions for social problems 
If the cause is individuals who can’t be socialized or are socialized inappropriately, what is the solution?
Social Control in the Pathology Perspective
Eugenics: early 20th century; sterilization/castration of deviants in the U.S.
As late as 1976, 26 states allowed involuntary sterilization of mentally ill; fewer states allowed procedure for mental retardation, epilepsy, sex offenders
Rise of therapeutic intervention: drug addiction, homosexuality, alcoholism, mental illness
Mental hospitals: “curative control”
Rise of pharmaceuticals; decline in mental institutions due to patients’ rights and declining funding
Re-socialization/moral education
Social Control from Deviance Perspective
The importance of formal and informal social ties and bonds to society at all ages across the life course
Childhood (the family and school)
Adolescence (family, schools, and some influence of peers, juvenile justice system)
Young adulthood (higher education, marriage, work, military service, criminal justice system)
Middle adulthood (work, marriage, parenthood, investment in the community, criminal justice system)
Can deviant behavior e good for society?
Durkheim (classical sociologist)
Crime is a natural kind of social activity, “an integral part of all healthy societies”
Performs a needed service by drawing people together in a common posture of anger and indignation
By doing so, they develop a tighter bond of solidarity than existed before
Creates a sense of mutuality by supplying a focus for group feeling
