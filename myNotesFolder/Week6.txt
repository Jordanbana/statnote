Individuals v. Society
Individual Agency v. Social Determinism
Individual Agency – idea that free will and personal choice determine outcomes
Social Determinism – there are structural elements or factors of society that determine outcomes, events, or processes
Did you choose to take this class?
Structured social action – collective agency operation within a social structure that constrains and enables choice
Social Structure
“The way social positions, social roles, and networks of social relationships are arranged in our institutions, such as the economy, polity, education, and organization of family“ – More than Just Race, p. 4
organized pattern of social relationships and social institutions
systems underlying our society
Examples of social structure
Economy: organization of jobs and workers
Education: system of teachers, students, administrators
Family: roles of parents and children
Friend groups: social relationships among people
Social Structures
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren
Police, infrastructure, education – shaping what people are able to do
What does social structure do?
Shapes opportunities, sanctions, and constraints
Structured social acts: individuals act within their role in a structure, and these acts can affect others
Social processes: “machinery of society” (Wilson 2009) that maintains or creates structured relations
Laws, policies, etc.
Structural Explanations
Argue that outcomes are the result of structured social relations in society
Social pathology and social disorganization theory?
Social pathology- focuses more on the individual, emphasizing individual choices and ability to become socialized or not
Social disorganization – much more about structure: people exist in peer groups or neighborhoods where relationships between people act as a way to socialize them
Connections with social institutions contribute to outcomes
Culture (contrast with structure)
“sharing of outlooks and modes of behavior among individuals who face similar place-based circumstances… or have the same social networks” – More than Just Race, p.4
people who live in the same/similar places; have the same/similar social relations may share the same culture
Examples of Culture
Shared outlooks/belief systems/ worldviews: liberal or conservative
Modes of behaviors: ways of doing things
Traditions: linked to racial/ethnic/national background
Values/preferences: ideas about wrong/right; desires, goals
Styles of self-presentation, etiquette, and linguistic patterns
What does culture do?
Shapes individual actions: individuals make decisions and choices that reflect their understanding of the world
Like structure, culture is something collective that shapes individual attitudes
Often seen as more individualistic than social structure
National views and beliefs
Culture of Social Groups
Mean girls cafeteria table scene and when she gets invited to eat lunch with the mean girls every day for the rest of the week
Structure is organization and culture is the content/stuff inside that structure
Cultural Explanations
Outcomes are the result of individuals acting in line with cultural values
Cultural explanation for crime: deviant/criminal subcultures that value violence; don’t value laws; teach behaviors
The Interrupters video clip
Top Hat: In order for society to function smoothly, ethnic minorities must adapt to American culture
Ethnic Minority Culture
In order for society to function smoothly, ethnic minorities must adapt to American culture (2002)
Cultural capital: habits and orientations valued by [the education system, employers, etc.] (Pierre Bourdieu)
Diversity of cultures within and between groups
What creates structure and culture?
Structural conditions can shape culture 
if you are poor and minority, you develop opposition culture where you value different things, don’t value education
Culture can shape structure 
As women fought for equality (right to vote, own property, equals), changes laws, workplace policy, wages
Structure and culture can change over time
Both cultural and structural forces shape future culture and structure
“Culture of Poverty”
Oscar Lewis “Culture of Poverty”
Culture emerged among marginalized populations to deal with low status
Low aspirations, political apathy, helplessness, disorganization, discouragement of “middle-class” values
Once such a culture was in place, it perpetuated itself even if structural conditions changed
Seen as “blaming the victim”
Obesity as a social problem
Obesity Rates
Structural explanations?
Exercise, incomeCultural explanations?
For Wednesday: article from Coates- case for reparations, controversial talked-about thing, African American social commenter who writes on racial inequality has not gone away

Discussion
Black people, culture, and poverty
Author uses black interchangeably with poor
10% non-Hispanic whites are living in poverty in 2012 versus 27% of blacks
take impoverished communities and move them out of cities to lower-class suburbs → doesn’t work because next generation moves back to cities
2005-2012 – white officer used deadly force against black people 2x / week, and 1/5 were under 21
Jonathan Ferrel – former Florida A & M football player, after kicking out his back window getting in a car, went to a house but people thought he was dangerous, officer killed Ferrel
Made up white and black sounding names, applied to jobs. White sounding names were 50% more likely to be called for an initial interview (structural)
Fallacy that black culture and poverty culture are one in the same

Continuation of Eyes on the Prize
Freedom Riders and MLK
Gave context of racial inequality and human rights
An Insanely Short History (of race in America)
1619-1865 – slavery of Africans forcibly brought to the US and owned by Southern plantation owners
1800-1866  Black codes: restricted free blacks’ political, economic, and social freedoms in the North and (particularly) the south
1868: 14th amendment: citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws for all people of all races
1870: 15th amendment prohibits government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on race
other barriers to vote in the south: poll taxes, literacy tests, white-only primaries
1965: voting rights act: enforces 15th amendment
1876-1965: Jim Crow Laws
“de jure” racial segregation in public facilities in the south
1896: Plessy v. Ferguson: “separate but equal”
1954: Brown v. Board outlaws school segregation
1964: Civil Rights Act outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in places that serve the public and at the workplace and schools
Racial Inequality
Income, wealth, education, neighborhood context, incarceration rates
Income Inequality
The figure shows that Asian people have the highest median household income, followed by non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and blacks
Whites and Asians have median household incomes that are higher than the median income of all races combined while Hispanics and blacks have median incomes that are lower
Wealth Inequality
Whites have always had more wealth than blacks, but this gap has grown over time. By 2009, the median white American has $98,000 in net worth while the median black American has just $2,200
White jumps around sometimes, but trend is increasing
Black is going down -> very low net worth for blacks
Property is key! One of the factors is a barrier for blacks owning more expensive homes, so their assets are not as high
Educational attainment
Percentage of 25-29 year olds with a bachelor’s degree or higher, by race/ethnicity
40% for whites, 60% for Asians, 25% for blacks, <20% for Hispanics
you see a lot of Hispanic/white inequality for completion of high school, but not black
Neighborhood Inequality
Racial composition of neighborhoods (extreme poverty and high poverty)
People living in extreme poverty neighborhoods: 45% black (does not mean that 45% of blacks live in extreme poverty neighborhoods)
Blacks and Latinos have a higher representation here
Middle-class Blacks’ and Whites’ neighborhoods
Average middle class white Philadelphia: $53,195. Average middle class black Philadelphia: $34,741
Are the causes of black crime unique?
No! Effects of neighborhood rates of poverty, family “disruption”, vacancy, residential mobility operate for both blacks and whites…
BUT blacks live in remarkably different neighborhoods than whites with different levels of social organization
The “worst” urban contexts in which whites resides are considerably better than the average for blacks
Incarceration Rates
More than one in 3 young, back men without a high school diploma is currently behind bars
On a given day, 35% of young black men without a high school diploma are in jail!!!! **
Four Part definition of a social problem
Is racial inequality a social problem?
Alleged condition 
From a census, so yes!
Incompatible with the values
Social mobility – the American dream
We want an open society with equal opportunities
Of a significant number of people
Top Hat: in general, do you think that blacks have as good a chance as whites to get a job? 1964- no, 2009: 79% say yes, 19% say no, but so don’t know if you can consider this a problem on that basis now that we have a black president
Who agree that change is needed
How different groups are treated
Blacks: 47%
Asians 69% 
Hispanics 48%
Arabs 42%
Should government give blacks special treatment to better their situation?
Most of the general population lean towards no
Is this substantial enough to see if change is called for? Think about how severe the problem is and what are the values of society
Structural Causes of Racial Inequality
Social acts
Discrimination
Social processes
Social structure: things that are in place to make you follow the rules (the systems: education, economic)
Social culture: behaviors, norms, to act within the social structure
Structure: Social Acts
“Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field experiment on Labor Market Discrimination” Bertrand & Mullainathan
respond to ads in Boston & Chicago newspapers
randomized names on identical resumes
“White-sounding” names received 50% more callbacks for interviews
conclusion: employers are being discriminatory because they are judging the resumes based on race
Structure: Social Process
Shift form goods-producing to service-producing economy
Lack of jobs for low-skilled workers
Spatial mismatch of where people live and where jobs are
Monetary policy: declining value of minimum wage; regressive tax structure
Low marriage rates (family disorganization)
Unequal neighborhood contexts (caused by policies)
Segregated public schools with lower resources
